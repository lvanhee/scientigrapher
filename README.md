# scientigrapher
This project is dedicated to generate graphics (or maybe other experiences) that reflect the career of a scientist. It initially started as a fun play with existing tools, and I now want to further streamline the process; so as to make a good presents to friends of mine.

As I played around with some text processing, I found interesting to use such tools to depict a given piece of science or a scientific career. How has your interest or discourse evolved over time? Would you be curious to speak to your former scientific self?
Given the amount of traces that a scientist leaves behind him/her, this is very feasible.

The project is open to anyone willing to contribute: the limit is your imagination. I only know a few tools, but there are so many unique experiences possible. What if you add yours? :)
